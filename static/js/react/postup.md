# Instructions for developing
* download nodejs (just for npm)
* then do install "npm install" in lab6/static/js, this will install webpack 
* then from lab6/static/js do "nodejs node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --progress --colors --watch"
  this will watch for changes in entry.jsx and consequently in everything that's used there and recompile 
  it when anything changes
